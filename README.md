We team MirazeX from Trident Academy of Technology, Bhubaneswar are providing sustainable solutions for a major problem that mostly occur in urban places.

A Life Stuck in Traffic: The Birth of a Solution  
The morning was chaotic. Asutosh, a school student, was on his way to an important competitive exam that could shape his future. The streets were packed with honking cars, bikes squeezing through narrow gaps, and frustrated drivers impatiently waiting for the signal to turn green.  
As he anxiously checked his watch, a piercing siren echoed through the congestion. An ambulance was stuck just a few cars ahead of him. The red and blue lights flashed desperately, but there was nowhere for it to go. The driver honked and signaled for vehicles to move aside, but the road was too tight. No one could move.  
 Asutosh saw the tense expressions of the paramedics inside the ambulance. They were attending to a patient in critical condition, who was fighting for life, but the only battle that mattered now was against time and traffic. Every passing second felt like a countdown to tragedy. Yet, the traffic light remained red, oblivious to the urgency of the moment.  
Finally, after several painful minutes, the vehicles slowly crawled forward, and the ambulance managed to break free. But deep inside, I felt uneasy. What if it was already too late?  
The next morning, as he scrolled through the news, his heart sank.  
 "Patient in Ambulance Stuck in Traffic Dies Before Reaching Hospital."  
His mind raced. The ambulance he had seen yesterday… Was it the same one? Could they have survived if traffic had moved faster? How many lives are lost like this every single day?  
That day, a question changed everything.  
What if traffic signals could think? What if they could sense an ambulance and clear the way in real time?  
And just like that, a solution was born.  
The Problem: Time Lost, Lives Lost  
He began researching. He found that every year, thousands of patients die because ambulances get stuck in traffic. Sirens alone aren’t enough—drivers try their best to give way, but jam-packed roads and static traffic signals make it impossible.  
What’s the real issue?  
1. Traffic lights don’t recognize emergencies. They operate on fixed timers and don’t change for ambulances.  
2. Vehicles have nowhere to move. Even if drivers want to help, congestion leaves them trapped.  
3. Not all ambulances carry the same urgency. Some are transporting stable patients, while others are racing against death. There’s no system to prioritize high-risk cases. 
The biggest tragedy? This problem already has a solution—we just haven’t implemented it yet.  
The Solution: AI-VANCE
  He thought, "What if AI could control traffic signals? What if cameras could see ambulances and respond instantly?" 
Instead of waiting for traffic to clear manually, what if the system itself could detect, decide, and act within seconds?
His idea was simple but revolutionary:  
1. AI-Powered Cameras 
   - Cameras at intersections will scan for ambulance 300 meters away.  
   - When detected, AI will turn the ambulance’s lane green, while keeping others red.  
   - Once the ambulance crosses the intersection, signals return to normal.  
2️. Sound-Based Prioritization 
   - Ambulances have different siren levels:
     *Low Risk: Stable patient transport.  
     *Moderate Risk: Urgent but manageable cases.  
     *High Risk: Critical emergencies.  
   - Microphones installed at signals will recognize the siren intensity and prioritize the most critical ambulance if multiple arrive at once.  
This way, an ambulance carrying a heart attack patient will get priority over one carrying a stable patient. *Lives will no longer be lost due to delayed response.  
The Impact: A City That Saves Lives  
Faster Emergency Response: Critical patients reach hospitals quicker, increasing survival rates.  Smarter Traffic Management: AI adapts signals in real-time, reducing unnecessary stops.  Emergency Prioritization: High-risk patients get priority when multiple ambulances arrive.       Cost-Effective & Scalable: Uses existing infrastructure with AI upgrades.  
For him , this was no longer just an idea—it was a mission to save lives.  
What if this system had already been in place? Would that patient from yesterday’s news still be alive?  
What if traffic signals could save lives? Now, it’s time to make that "what if" a reality.
